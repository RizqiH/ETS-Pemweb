      <p class="my-4">
        Since the day we started back in 2017, HURTS-SPACE. has been built bit-by-bit with the help of friends, whanau and most importantly our wider community. The brand couldn't have started more organically even if we tried. Since those first plain black t-shirts, we've always tried to stay true to ourselves. Getting our friends and whanau to model, the super creatives to take the photos & even parents to help pick and pack orders.
      </p>
      
      <p class="my-4">
        Since then, we have grown and turned this passion project into a reality. We are on a mission to become a household name in fashion in Aotearoa.

        WE JUST USED TO SAY "YOU KNOW!" AS A TERM OF ENDEARMENT. KIND OF LIKE "YOU KNOW, I GOT YOU...". IT WAS SUCH A CATCHY PHRASE, WE THOUGHT WHY NOT PUT IT ON A T-SHIRT? BOOM! "YOUKNOW. CLOTHING" IS BORN.
